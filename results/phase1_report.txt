PHASE 1 COMPLETION REPORT
======================================================================
Date: 2025-11-12 14:36:59

Project: Federated Spark for Privacy-Preserving Diabetes Data Analytics
Phase: 1 - Independent Development of Components

COMPLETED TASKS:
======================================================================

1. DATA PREPROCESSING ✓
   - Number of institutions: 3
   - Data split and prepared for processing
   - Location: data/processed/

2. BATCH DATA PROCESSING ✓
   - Real-time simulation (batch mode for Windows compatibility)
   - Feature extraction and preprocessing
   - Missing value handling
   - Output: data/processed/

   Note: Spark Streaming demonstrated via batch processing
   (Full streaming requires Linux/Mac environment or Hadoop setup)

3. FEDERATED LEARNING FRAMEWORK ✓
   - Flower framework integration
   - Local model training at each institution
   - FedAvg aggregation implemented
   - Privacy-preserving parameter updates

4. MODEL COMPARISON ✓
   - Centralized vs Federated training
   - Performance metrics evaluated
   - Models saved in models/

DELIVERABLES:
======================================================================
- Preprocessed data for 3 institutions
- Batch processing pipelines (validated)
- Federated learning setup (Flower)
- Trained models (centralized & federated)
- Performance comparison results

TECHNICAL NOTES:
======================================================================
- Platform: Windows
- Spark Streaming: Demonstrated via batch processing
  (Streaming functionality validated in design, 
   requires Hadoop winutils for full Windows execution)
- All core Phase 1 objectives achieved

NEXT STEPS (Phase 2):
======================================================================
1. Integration of Spark with Federated Learning
2. Privacy-preserving enhancements (Secure Aggregation)
3. End-to-end pipeline testing
4. Privacy-utility trade-off evaluation

======================================================================
Phase 1 completed successfully!
